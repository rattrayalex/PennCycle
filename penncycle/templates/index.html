  <p>Philly is one of the best parts about being at Penn, but getting around can be an incredible pain. Biking is the easiest option, but owning a bike? Not so much.</p>
  <p>Who wants to spend their time oiling a chain, fixing a brake, or storing a bike for the summer and winter? Who wants to pay upwards of $500 for a bike when textbooks and trips to Blarney are taking their toll?</p>
  <p>Not the Penn Students we know.</p>
  <p>PennCycle is affordable, reliable, and super easy &#8212; not to mention fun, sustainable, and healthy. Just like transportation should be.</p>
  <p>Happy Cycling!</p>
